        <h2>What I Wish I Knew Before Taking My First Shot</h2>

        <p>
          Starting photography feels exciting—like you’re finally stepping into
          a new way of seeing the world. But it can also feel overwhelming.
          Aperture? ISO? Which camera to buy? Should you be editing everything?
          Should you even be posting yet?
        </p>

        <p>
          Take a breath. Whether you're holding a phone, a used DSLR, or a
          brand-new mirrorless camera, you're in the right place. Here's what I
          wish someone told me when I picked up my first camera—before the gear
          obsessions, before the blur, before the YouTube rabbit holes.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="photography gear.jpg"
            alt="A photographer's camera bag with various camers and lenses."
          />
          <figcaption>
            Secondhand cameras, lenses, and tripods will take you far.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Gear Doesn’t Matter <i>(Yet)</i></p>

        <p>
          I know. The first thing you did (and I did too) was Google “best
          camera for beginners.” But here's the truth: Any camera is a good
          starting point. Your smartphone, your grandparent’s old film camera,
          or a used entry-level DSLR from a pawn shop—all of them can teach you
          how to compose, how to observe light, and how to tell a story.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of chasing the next lens or body, focus on learning what your
          current gear can do. Understanding exposure, focus, and framing will
          take you much further than upgrading your kit every few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try this:</b> Challenge yourself to shoot with only one camera and
          one lens (or just your phone) for a week. Learn what its limits
          are—and how to push them.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="photography lights.jpg"
            alt="A photography studio with various lighting equipment."
          />
          <figcaption>
            The right lighting setup can significantly improve a photograph.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Light is Everything</p>

        <p>
          No, seriously. Light is everything. It’s what turns a dull snapshot
          into a photo that feels alive. Before you even think about settings,
          start observing how light behaves. Notice how shadows shift during the
          day. Watch how the color of light changes from sunrise to sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you start to “see” light, your photos instantly get better—no
          matter your gear or skill level.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try this:</b> Shoot the same subject three times in one
          day—morning, midday, and golden hour—and notice the difference.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="camera auto setting.jpg"
            alt="A zoom in of a camera's mode dial set to auto."
          />
          <figcaption>
            Don't dive head-first into camera settings, take baby steps.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Auto Mode Is a Tool, Not a Trap</p>

        <p>
          There’s no shame in using Auto mode. It's there to help you learn.
          Think of it like training wheels—not something to rely on forever, but
          a way to stay balanced while you build confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use Auto, but pay attention to what your camera is doing. Look at the
          settings it chooses in different situations. Then start experimenting
          with Aperture Priority (A/Av) or Shutter Priority (S/Tv) to take more
          control, one step at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try this:</b> Take one photo in Auto, then try to recreate it in
          Manual or Aperture Priority. Compare the results—and the process.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="photo gallery.jpg"
            alt="Topview of two people looking at a photo gallery on a laptop."
          />
          <figcaption>
            In most cases, your first shot, won't be your best.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Don’t Fear the Messy Shots</p>

        <p>
          Your early photos might be blurry, overexposed, too dark, or just
          plain boring. That’s normal. You’re learning a visual language, and
          you need to take “bad” photos to find your voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          So don’t delete everything that doesn’t look perfect. Keep those
          mistakes. Look at them. Learn from them. You’ll be amazed at how
          quickly you grow when you stop trying to be good, and start trying to
          be curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try this:</b> Set a goal to take 100 photos this week—and don’t
          delete any of them. Review them later, and write down what you liked
          and didn’t like.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="photography instagram.jpg"
            alt="A hand holding a cellphone displaying a photographer's social media account featuring a grid of photgraphs."
          />
          <figcaption>
            As you improve, your shared work will start to attract clients.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Share Early, Share Often</p>

        <p>
          You don’t need to be an expert to share your work. In fact, sharing
          your early work is part of becoming an expert. Feedback,
          encouragement, and even simple likes can help you stay motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, sharing helps you see your progress over time. Don’t
          wait until your photos are “good enough.” Start now. Let people see
          you grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Try this:</b> Start a small Instagram account or online album just
          for your photography journey. Give yourself permission to post without
          pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your first roll—whether it’s actual film or a fresh SD card—isn’t
          about perfection. It’s about exploration. You’re learning how to see
          in a new way. That takes time, and every blurry photo is part of that
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          So keep shooting. Keep learning. Keep clicking that shutter. Your best
          photos are still ahead of you.

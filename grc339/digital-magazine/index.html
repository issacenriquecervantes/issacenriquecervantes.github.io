            <h2>What I Wish I Knew Before Taking My First Shot</h2>
            <p>
              Starting photography feels exciting—like you’re finally stepping
              into a new way of seeing the world. But it can also feel
              overwhelming. Aperture? ISO? Which camera to buy? Should you be
              editing everything? Should you even be posting yet? Take a breath.
              Whether you're holding a phone, a used DSLR, or a brand-new
              mirrorless camera, you're in the right place. Here's what I wish
              someone told me when I picked up my first camera—before the gear
              obsessions, before the blur, before the YouTube rabbit holes.

            <h2>Which Camera Should I Buy First?</h2>
            <p>
              With so many options—DSLRs, mirrorless systems, and even
              smartphones—choosing your first camera can feel like a big leap.
              We break down the best options for beginners based on your goals,
              budget, and shooting style, so you can start capturing without the
              stress.

              have to be intimidating. We’ll walk you through ISO, aperture, and
              shutter speed with simple visuals and real-world examples that
              actually make sense.
